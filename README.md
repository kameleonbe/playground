I finally decided to teach myself PHP better. Should have done this 15 years ago (better late then never). Yes I am a front-end developer and Angular.js and Node.js are more then buzz words, but I love Drupal. And Drupal.. . well it's gonna be PHP all over the place for at least the near future. Drupal 8 coming and it's not written in node.js or .NET. So.
